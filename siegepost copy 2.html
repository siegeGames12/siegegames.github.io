                        <p>
                            About three years ago, Capcom released the Iceborne expansion for Monster Hunter: World, which was a 
                            critical and commercial success for the Japanese company. Many fans found the Iceborne expansion to be 
                            the pinnacle of the series, adding in so much new content and mechanics that it felt more like a new entry 
                            instead of just more quests.<br><br>

                            Fast forward three years later, and Capcom's next Monster Hunter expansion, Sunbreak, is here, but this time 
                            for the Switch/PC exclusive Monster Hunter Rise. Comparing these two expansions might not be fair, as Rise 
                            and World are two very different games, but still, it's hard not to, especially since Rise was built off of 
                            World's quality of life features that make both games so approachable for newcomers.<br><br>

                            For anyone that's played Iceborne, the contents of Sunbreak aren't too different. There are returning monsters 
                            to hunt that come from classic Monster Hunter games, as well as brand-new monsters like Garangolm and the flagship 
                            monster, Malzeno.<br><br>

                            There's a new hub area called the Elgado Outpost, which is a bit smaller than Kamura Village, but still gives
                             players plenty to do. And, of course, the new Master Rank quests are added, giving hunters a challenging array of
                              missions to complete to see how the story plays out.<br><br>
                              
                            However, even with the dozens upon dozens (or even hundreds) of hours that players can spend with Sunbreak, it doesn't 
                            feel as grand or purposeful as Iceborne. It doesn't have as many new monsters as it should, and a lot of the quests, 
                            especially the early ones, involve hunting monsters players have already fought against in the base game.<br><br>

                            Even when players roll credits and continue in the Endgame, there are a lot of repeated monsters on the hunting list. There 
                            are some quests later on that players can unlock called Anomaly Quests, and the target monsters are afflicted with a virus that 
                            makes them enraged, sometimes even performing new attacks.<br><br>
                            
                            These quests sound cool in theory, but they don't feel that different from fighting the monster in a normal quest. It does add a 
                            bit more variety to the total package, especially since hunters can get unique materials from the afflicted monsters, but still, 
                            it's not one of the most memorable parts of the Sunbreak expansion.<br><br>

                            As a seasoned Monster Hunter fan, Sunbreak doesn't check all the boxes to make it feel like a complete and well-put-together package. 
                            That being said, it's still Monster Hunter Rise at the end of the day, which is a wonderful and well-executed experience that is 
                            worthy of praise. The Wirebug mechanics feel as good as ever with the quality of life updates added in Sunbreak, the new Switch 
                            Skill Swap adds more variety to a hunter's moveset, and hunting down monsters for the new master rank armor sets and weapons never 
                            gets old.<br><br>

                            There are a lot of neat little touches here and there that make Sunbreak a fun all-around experience, even without the game-changer 
                            that was the Clutch Claw back in Iceborne. For Monster Hunter Rise fans still looking to grind out some armor for dozens of more 
                            hours, Sunbreak will definitely deliver on that front.<br><br>

                            But for the die-hard Monster Hunter fans out there that are looking for something a little different than the base game, there's 
                            not much new stuff to partake in this time around. Sunbreak feels like DLC for Monster Hunter Rise's Endgame rather than being a 
                            proper full-blown expansion.

                            Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak™ is the monstrous new expansion for Monster Hunter Rise, the critically-acclaimed and top-selling
                            Monster Hunter™ title that released on Nintendo Switch in March 2021 and PC in January 2022. The story of Monster Hunter Rise:
                            Sunbreak begins following the heroic defense of Kamura Village that concludes in Monster Hunter Rise. In addition to the all-new
                            storyline, the expansion will introduce new monsters, new additions to combat, the Master Rank quest difficulty, and more when
                            it releases on June 30, 2022 for Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam.<br><br>
                            
                            After being summoned to aid the distant Kingdom by the
                            gallant knight Dame Fiorayne, the hunters set out for the port of Elgado Outpost. This bustling maritime waystation is the
                            home of the Laboratory researching the abnormal monster activity troubling the Kingdom, and the Command Post tasked with
                            restoring peace to the realm. The threat befalling the Kingdom is closely linked to powerful creatures known as the Three
                            Lords, each inspired by staples of Western horror. This cadre includes the newly unveiled Garangolm, the chilling Fanged Wyvern Lunagaron, and the Elder Dragon Malzeno. Researching the
                             behavior of the Three Lords will take hunters across the Kingdom to exciting new locales, including the newly-unveiled Citadel.
