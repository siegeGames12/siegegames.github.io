                            Cult of the Lamb is partly a rouge-like game. The rooms in each dungeon are procedurally generated, 
                            meaning no two runs can ever go exactly the same.<br><br>

                            At the end of every run, you'll need to defeat a boss to successfully complete a crusade. Do this three 
                            times and you'll have the chance to face and defeat the area's bishop.<br><br>
                            
                            This is how the rogue-like combat aspect of the game works. Fighting enemies can be easy at first, but 
                            later biomes contain enemies that are more difficult to deal with. Be sure to go in prepared each time 
                            you go out on a crusade with the following tips and tricks.<br><br>

                            Be Familiar With Every Weapon Type<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <p>

                            At the start of each run, you're given a random melee weapon and a curse to start with. There's no way for 
                            you to choose your desired specific type of weapon. This means you'll need to acclimate yourself with every 
                            weapon type if you want to deal with the enemies properly.<br><br>
                            
                            There are five different types of weapons in Cult of the Lamb. All of them have varying damage, range, and 
                            speed. The slower a weapon is, the harder it hits.<br><br>
                            
                            Daggers - Daggers have fast attack speeds, yet their damage and range are limited.<br>
                            Gauntlets - Gauntlets are also fast, yet they don't hit as hard. However, their attacks have a combo that progressively 
                            deals more damage.<br>
                            Swords - The most balanced weapon in the game. This weapon type has decent attack speed, range, and damage.<br>
                            Axes - Axes are slower than swords, but they have more range and deal more damage.<br>
                            Hammers - Hammers are the most powerful weapons in the game, but they're also the slowest. The hammers' 
                            attacks are targeted on a specific circular area, damaging those it lands on and those within close 
                            proximity to the AOE.

                            Description.<br><br>
                            Cult of the Lamb is centred around a possessed lamb that is tasked with forming a cult to appease the ominous deity 
                            who saved the player character's life. The player must launch roguelike-style crusades and venture out into the 
                            game's five regions to defeat enemies and grow their following.<br><br>

                            Cult of the Lamb is a single-player construction and management simulation, rogue-like action-adventure game developed 
                            by indie developer Massive Monster and published by Devolver Digital. The game was released on 11 August 2022 for macOS, 
                            Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. The game follows a possessed lamb 
                            who is saved from death by a god-like stranger named "The One Who Waits", and must repay their debt by creating a loyal 
                            following in its name.
