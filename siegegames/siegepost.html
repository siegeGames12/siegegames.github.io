                            KEEP ENEMIES AT BAY WITH REPEATED SLASHES. <br><br> You can keep enemies, primarily Rollers, Brushes,
                            and Splatana-Type wielding enemies, from pushing up the frontlines. Prevent enemies from taking the rainwater in the Rainmaker 
                            game mode and stop them from throwing clams in Clam Blitz by repeatedly swinging your weapon at them!<br><br>
                            DESTROYS ENEMY DEPLOYED SUB WEAPONS.<br><br>
                            This weapon damages and destroys sub weapons such as the Squid Beakon and Tacticooler much faster than most
                            other weapons. Be sure to use this to your advantage to put pressure on the enemy team and diminish their 
                            chances of winning!<br><br>

                            DON'T TRY TO PLAY IT AT MELEE/SHORT RANGE.<br><br> The melee one hit kill is very situational. I almost exclusively go melee after squid
                            surging a tower someone is occupying or jumping behind someone.<br><br> The weapon excels at mid range and keeping pressure. One charged
                            swing and a quick well placed hit with burst bomb is a good kill combo. You can also hit the enemy with a burst bomb first to slow
                             them down and then do a quick charged swing.<br><br>
                             
                             The special is of course great for mobility but it can also be used as a situation ink refill.

                            Description:<br><br>
                            The game was released worldwide on 9 September 2022. In a trailer on 11 October 2022, it was announced
                            that the Splatoon 3 amiibo would launch on November 11. Announced in the Splatoon 3 Nintendo Direct, the
                            game is set to receive both large-scale paid DLC and two years of support via free software updates.<br><br>

                            The game takes place 5 years after the events of Splatoon 2 in the Splatlands, a sun-scorched desert inhabited
                             by battle-hardened Inklings and Octolings, and Splatsville, a city of chaos that developed rapidly since the last
                              Splatfest of Splatoon 2, Chaos vs. Order.
